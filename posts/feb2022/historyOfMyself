I suppose it would be helpful for readers to know who I am. My name is Eric Lima, I have a knack for computers as I've been using them for most of my life. 

I intend to write this blog to woo potential employers or clients with my skillset. But really I also want to share some worthwhile insights and experiences I have while I go thru my journey in life. That said I intend to cater this blog more into the tech side of things.

I'm not going to bore readers of my lifes journey but I will briefly mention a few things. I got into computers at a young age because I was a really avid video game player. When I noticed kids didn't wan to go out as much anymore I began to learn how to play emulator games and such back in the 1990s. I always used computers as a tool to make life more fun and enjoyable. Even back then though, I realized I was quite ahead of others when it came to being tech savvy. So from early on I realized I should probably specialize in computers. 

Fast forward a bunch, I'm now 32 and it's the year 2022. I have gone thru universisty and obtained a computer science bachelor's degree from a univeristy called Umass Lowell. I've also had about 8+ years of front end (and some back end too) web development professional experience. I plan to do a whole lot more within my limmited life time! If anything writing this made me realize how old I'm getting. I'm already half way thru becoming financially independant and who knows what lies next in life. Perhaps I'll wind up old and gray, with a few little ones running around? Time will tell.
