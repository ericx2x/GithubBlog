Hello world. I intend to use this github repo as a way of hosting some blog posts. I am quite shy and usually prefer to code by myself in a dark room far from interactions with others but I figure I should switch things up once in a while.

This blog is intended to share some of my insights on my most recent works. I will also be careful as to not share any censitive information regarding employer or client work.

Hope you enjoy reading!

P.S. did you know Brian Kernighan actually wrote the first "hello, world" program as part of the documentation for the BCPL programming language? BCPL was used while C was being developed at Bell Labs in 1972.
